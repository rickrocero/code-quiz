# code-quiz

## Description

* My motivation for this project was to create a timed quiz using JavaScript to dynamically update the HTML and CSS.

* I build this website to make a quiz using Web APIs such as: 
    1) traversing the DOM using DOM nodes and CSS selectors 
    2) time intervals using the timeInterval() method, 
    3) HTML DOM addListener() method to listen for click events, 
    4) and the local storage to save user data

* JavaScript adds functionality to a webpage which creates an interactive user experience that cannot be done with just HTML and CSS. 

* I learned how manipulate a webpage with Web APIs using JavaScript!
